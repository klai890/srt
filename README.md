# Strava Running Tools
Inspired by [Toolbox for Strava](https://www.marcellobrivio.com/projects/strava-toolbox/). A similar project, but whereas _Toolbox for Strava_ was created with cyclists in mind, _Strava Running Tools_ is created with runners in mind.

## Features
* FED UP WITH ACTIVITIES NAMED "AFTERNOON RUN?" => Change default activity names
* WANT TO TRACK MILEAGE IN A SPREADSHEET **AND** STRAVA? => Export mileage log in a format that you can actually _read_, unlike what Strava currently provides
* WANT TO WORSHIP YOUR SHOES? => Keep a photo album containing fond memories of your shoes, chat with your shoes because that's what AI should be used for

## IN PROGRESS, RELEASE DATE: JAN 19, 2023
