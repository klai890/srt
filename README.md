# Strava Running Tools (In Progress)
Inspired by [Toolbox for Strava](https://www.marcellobrivio.com/projects/strava-toolbox/). A similar project, but whereas _Toolbox for Strava_ was created with cyclists in mind, _Strava Running Tools_ is created with runners in mind.

## Features
- Track mileage on existing logs and Strava!
  - Export mileage log in a format that you can actually read!
- Change default activity names!
  - Because "Afternoon Run" is just boring!
 
## Release Date: January 27th, 2023!
